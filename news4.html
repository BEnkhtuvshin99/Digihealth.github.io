        <div class="Description">
            <p>Existing AI applications in healthcare are broadly categorized into diagnosis, clinical decision-making, and prognosis [2, 6]. 
                The joint team from ULL and NUM focused on developing a machine-learning model capable of detecting and predicting tooth cavities in children based 
                on the data collected and labeled by the MNUMS team.
                To achieve this, the team first prepared training data by examining children aged 3 to 6. Each child underwent a full oral examination using an intraoral camera,
                 which produced around ten images per child. These images and diagnoses made by pediatric dentists formed the core of the dataset. 
                In addition to the image data, the children’s guardians were asked to complete a 47-question survey covering five categories, including health information and oral
                 care habits.
                Several kindergartens volunteered to participate in the study, allowing the team to gather a larger pool of data. As part of this effort, free dental examinations
                 were conducted in dental offices, ensuring a thorough and accessible data collection process. By combining intraoral images, diagnoses, and survey responses, the 
                 team created a comprehensive dataset that not only helped train the machine learning model but also provided valuable insights into children's oral health.
                After labeling the initial batch of data, the ULL team immediately trained a prediction model. During this phase, we encountered a significant imbalance in the 
                dataset, as certain category labels were underrepresented, resulting in the model’s inability to detect them. This imbalance occurred because the initial batch 
                contained fewer samples for some categories, which affected the model's performance by skewing predictions toward the more common categories (Figure 10).
                In the second phase of data labeling, we focused on resolving this issue. We took a targeted approach to gather additional data specifically 
                for the underrepresented categories, aiming to create a more balanced dataset. While this effort improved the overall distribution (Figure 10), 
                some categories remained imbalanced due to their rarity in general cases, although they are still crucial to classify.</p>
