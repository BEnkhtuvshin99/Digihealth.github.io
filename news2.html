            <p>The team used the Python Label Studio package to classify each image into one of the 16 predefined categories for the data labeling process. 
                This tool made it easier for everyone to manage and organize the dental images effectively. 
                To ensure all team members were comfortable with the software, the ULL team provided hands-on training to resident doctors, 
                guiding them through the step-by-step labeling process (Figure 5). In addition to the in-person sessions, 
                they also created a video tutorial demonstrating how to use another annotation tool, 
                the VGG Image Annotator (VIA), so the doctors could practice independently whenever needed.
                A crucial part of the project was securing ethical approval from the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences research boards. 
                This approval ensured that the data was handled responsibly and paved the way for the project’s open data initiative. 
                By getting the green light from the ethics board, the team ensured that the data could be accessible for future research, 
                fostering transparency and encouraging collaboration within the scientific community.
                The data labeling process ran slowly but smoothly, and everyone was properly trained and had ethical approval. 
                The combination of thorough preparation, clear communication, and the right tools helped ensure the data was classified accurately, 
                setting the stage for meaningful analysis of the dental images.</p>

                This collaboration ensured consistent labeling across different diagnoses, such as healthy teeth, various stages of caries, pulpitis, 
                fillings, and more. Each diagnosis was carefully marked by outlining the relevant areas in the image, ensuring that the condition was accurately highlighted.
                If there were any uncertainties during the diagnosis, the team cross-referenced the patient's medical record to confirm the findings. 
                The dental conditions were labeled in detail, including categories like healthy enamel, staining, superficial cavities, deep caries, 
                pulpitis, fillings, fluorosis, hypoplasia, and other specific dental issues. 
                This methodical approach helped maintain precision throughout the labeling process. 
                The 16 categories chosen for the label are described below.
